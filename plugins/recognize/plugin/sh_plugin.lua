--- Recognize gives every character a list of the characters it recognizes and the names it
-- knows them by.
-- A character is a stranger to everyone until they introduce themselves, under their real
-- name or a false one, to the player they look at or to everyone within whisper, talk or
-- yell range: from the menu on the ShowTeam key (F2 by default) or from the menu that
-- opens when another player is used. A player sees the name they know a character by on
-- the target ID, in in-character chat messages, on the scoreboard and in the typing bubbles;
-- strangers are shown as a stranger or by the start of their physical description. A
-- character can forget someone again from the menu that opens when that player is used or
-- from the menu of their scoreboard card, and staff make characters forget with the
-- CharForget and CharClearRecognition commands.
--
-- The `recog_enabled` config turns the whole system off, which makes everyone recognize
-- everyone. `recog_must_see` makes introductions need a clear line of sight, and
-- `recog_forget_on_death` and `recog_forgotten_on_death` decide what a death erases.
--
-- `Player:recognizes`, `Player:knows_real_name` and `Player:get_recognize` read the
-- recognitions on both realms; `Player:add_recognize`, `Player:remove_recognize` and
-- `Player:clear_recognizes` change them on the server. The `PlayerRecognizeTarget` hook
-- makes a player recognize another regardless of what is stored, and `PlayerCanRecognize`
-- and `PlayerCanForget` can refuse what players ask for.
