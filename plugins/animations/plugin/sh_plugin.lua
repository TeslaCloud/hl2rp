--- Animations lets players put their character into a stance or make it perform a gesture,
-- picked from a panel in the context menu.
-- An animation is registered with `Animations:register_anim` and is made of sequences of
-- the player's model: an optional enter sequence, the main sequence and an optional exit
-- sequence. A stance holds its main sequence until the player presses a movement key or
-- picks an animation again; a one-shot gesture plays it once and ends by itself. For as
-- long as the animation lasts the player cannot move, jump, crouch or attack, is rendered
-- at the angle they started it at and, with the `animations_third_person` config on, sees
-- themselves in third person. The panel only lists the animations that the model of the
-- local player has the sequences of.
--
-- The server runs everything: it checks the request (`Animations:can_play`), plays the
-- sequences with `Player:set_animation`, which shows them to every client, and ends the
-- animation when the framework drops the sequence because the player has died, spawned or
-- got another model, as well as when they switch characters, leave, are ragdolled, enter a
-- vehicle or noclip, or are moved away. Clients only read the two networked variables of
-- the player: `fl_animation`, the ID of the animation they are playing, and
-- `fl_animation_angle`, the angle they are rendered at.
--
-- Plugins can veto an animation with the server hook `PlayerCanPlayAnimation`. The
-- `animations_cooldown` config sets how soon a player may start another animation.

-- it builds, since a command reaches the server the way the client has left it and the

-- of the movement in the `Move` handler on both sides.
