--- Radios lets characters talk to each other over any distance.
-- A radio is an item with a frequency. A character who keeps an enabled radio in their
-- hotbar speaks on its frequency by starting a chat message with one of
-- `Communications.prefixes`, and everyone with an enabled radio tuned to that frequency in
-- their own hotbar receives the message wherever they are. The players standing near the
-- speaker overhear it, like anything else that is said out loud.
--
-- The frequency of a radio is changed through its item menu: the server asks the player
-- for the new frequency with a prompt and checks the answer before the radio is retuned.
--
-- Three server-side hooks surround a transmission: `PlayerCanRadio` can forbid a player to
-- speak on the radio, `PlayerAdjustRadioInfo` decides who receives the message and
-- `PlayerRadioUsed` is run once it has been sent. If the Display Typing plugin is loaded,
-- players who are typing a radio message are shown as 'radioing'.
