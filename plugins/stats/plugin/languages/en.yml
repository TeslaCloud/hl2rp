    strength:
      title: Strength
      short: STR
      description:
        Physical fitness of your character. Affects the chance of a
        successful bruteforce action, such as knocking down a door.
      superb:
        Your strength is akin to that of an Olympian. You are able
        to deadlift much weight with minimal effort, and your melee
        has the potential of being fatal.
      great:
        Your muscles are in fine shape. Able to lift heavy objects
        with some effort, your melee is indeed a strong counter to foes.
      good:
        Your strength is above average. You are able to lift heavy objects
        with strenuous efforts that may fatigue, your melee has good defensive potential.
      fair:
        Your strength is average. You have difficulty lifting heavy
        objects, and you may injure yourself if great caution is not used.
        In melee, it may be easy to be overpowered.
      mediocre:
        Your strength is somewhat poor. Objects with even a small amount of
        weight to them can feel unwieldy and clumsy. In melee, your efforts
        largely go wasted without the assistance of a weapon.
      poor:
        You hold little to no strength whatsoever. Applying any physical
        effort to anything, even walking in some cases, can be of extreme
        difficulty. In melee, you are easily overpowered by mostly everything.
      terrible:
        No strength. Applying any strength to any activity may in fact be
        of some detriment to you. Your melee is unheard of, you are so
        delicate that a strong breeze could knock you over.
    reflexes:
      title: Reflexes
      short: REF
      description:
        Dexterity and reaction timings of your character. Takes effect in
        lockpicking, dodging, etc.
      superb: 
        Your reflexes are as sharp as a Ninja. Performing great feats
        of agility is of no effort to you, and your hands are naturally
        nimble and clever. Your melee is extremely easy to land, you also
        avoid strikes with ease.
      great:
        Your reflexes are really great. Applying reflexes to anything comes
        with relative ease, and some acrobatics come naturally to you. Your
        melee is easy to land, and foes have difficulty landing strikes on you.
      good:
        Your agility is above that of the average person. You can make strides
        up stairs with ease and are unlikely to lose your balance in your average
        daily affairs. Though you are not a parkour master or an excellent fighter,
        your skills are notable.
      fair:
        Your agility is that of the average human. You have a fair time 
        getting around normally, but begin to struggle when encountered with 
        climbing large obstacles or quickly vaulting over objects. Nothing about 
        your speed or dexterity is notable.
      mediocre:
        You have mediocre agility. You may appear clumsy or slow to a 
        mild degree, and have difficulty climbing or hiking your way around rough 
        terrain. Your punches land slower than average.
      poor:
        Your agility is far below average, you are quite the slow runner 
        and find yourself having a difficult time when it comes to races 
        between others.
      terrible: 
        You are quite slow, going at speeds that most if not 
        all can keep up with. This could almost be deemed as a handicap. 
    perception:
      title: Perception
      short: PER
      description:
        General awareness of your character. Affects the chance of
        noticing something quick enough, or something that your opponent cannot see.
      superb:
        Your visual and audible senses are extraordinary. Spotting a needle in a 
        haystack is one of the easiest tasks you can perform, next to being able 
        to differentiate twins (or even CPs). A sneaking person will have a hard 
        time getting past you.
      great:
        Your attentiveness is very remarkable. Noticing small details even from 
        a distance is possible while close-up objects are almost viewed in slow 
        motion. Decrypting noises is also much easier and more effective.
      good:
        Your skill to observe from a distance and perceive quiet noises is more 
        than average. Hard to beat in thimbles, you are likely to spot an enemy 
        before they spot you and can keep creeping around while paying attention 
        to distant footsteps.
      fair:
        Your senses are in working condition and unremarkable. Sudden changes 
        are easy to spot while distant figures can be identified over time. 
        Hearing approaching footsteps is a challenging, but manageable task.
      mediocre:
        You have a common issue with your sighting and listening. It is possible 
        for you to notice objects from far away, but not differentiate or identify 
        them. Most noises are unclear and very dull compared to each other.
      poor:
        Your defect organs of perception work quite poorly. Small animals or objects 
        are a rare sight, if ever perceived by you in whatever way. Listening to 
        suppressed noises is not an option since they might confuse you more than 
        provide information.
      terrible:
        Your illnesses associated with hearing or vision have devastating effects. 
        You are almost deaf or have very bad eyesight. Even processing the most 
        simple signals by others appears very hard for you.
    endurance:
      title: Endurance
      short: END
      description:
        General fitness and toughness of your character. Determines how
        much beating they can take.
      superb:
        Your body is the true meaning of durability and discipline. There are 
        many different forms of pain and potential challenges you can put yourself 
        through and you will most likely come out unscathed.
      great:
        You are extremely hardy. You almost do not get sick and easily master 
        the mountain hike.
      good:
        Although strong, your body has only started its journey. You can take 
        a beating and can outlast most people in physical activities where others falter.
      fair:
        Just like nearly everyone else, your physical form is plainly standard. 
        You tolerate pain and can steadily take on difficulties for a period of time.
      mediocre:
        You’re not that fit or tolerant, but can still hold your own. While 
        you suffer physically like when climbing upstairs and becoming tired, 
        it doesn’t usually get worse from there.
      poor:
        Your body is fragile, more so than most. You attract sickness like a 
        moth to a flame and your character suffers from walking various distances.
      terrible:
        You are constantly exhausted and always want to sleep. You do not even 
        remember the last time you were properly healthy.
    intelligence:
      title: Intelligence
      short: INT
      description:
        Strength of mind. Determines how smart your character is. Can
        come in handy when mentally assaulting other characters.
      superb:
        You are a genius. Your IQ is far above average, your knowledge covers 
        a lot of very different areas. Not many can match you when it comes to 
        a battle of wits.
      great:
        You are extremely smart. Complex sciences are given to you quite easily. 
        You are mentally fast, able to calculate workarounds much faster than most. 
      good:
        Your IQ is above average. You are very erudite and can solve most of 
        the tasks. You are not bad at making almost perfect decisions.
      fair:
        You have a normal level of intelligence. You had a decent education 
        given to you. You know your way around most problems/situations when they arise.
      mediocre:
        You are not too smart. Exact sciences are given to you with difficulty. 
        You can work your way around a problem if you think hard enough.
      poor:
        Your mental abilities are insignificant. It is hard for you to express 
        your thoughts. You may find it quite hard to exit out of situations 
        requiring strategical thinking. 
      terrible:
        You are weak-minded. It is difficult for you to pronounce words. 
        Difficult situations are almost impossible for you.
